## Experiments (A3)

(1) Ablation study. As shown in the following tables, each
component of SmartGuard has a positive impact on results. The
combination of all components brings the best results on FR and SP dataset.

(2) Parameter experiments. As shown in Figure(a), when mask ratio is 0.8, step w/o mask is 6, SmartGuard achieves the best anomaly detection performance on FR dataset. As shown in Figure(b), on SP dataset, when mask ratio is 0.6, step w/o mask is 6, SmartGuard achieves the best performance.
